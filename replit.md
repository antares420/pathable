# Wheelchair Navigation Assistant

## Overview

A comprehensive real-time accessibility-focused navigation system specifically designed for wheelchair users. The application combines Flask backend with WebSocket communication, advanced computer vision for wheelchair-specific obstacle detection, and text-to-speech functionality to provide audio navigation guidance. The system detects wheelchair accessibility obstacles like stairs, curbs, narrow passages, steep slopes, and surface types while providing alternative route suggestions. It operates in demo mode (simulation) and camera mode (real-time analysis) to help wheelchair users navigate safely and find accessible routes.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Recent Changes

* **Localized Emergency Contact (September 5, 2025)**: Updated emergency contact number from 911 to 100 for Nepal's local emergency services
* **Enhanced Nepal Maps Interface (September 5, 2025)**: Complete Google Maps-like navigation interface using Baato API for Nepal with improved wheelchair-accessible route planning:
  - **Improved Location Selection**: Click-to-select functionality - users can click on input fields and then click anywhere on the map to select start and destination points with automatic reverse geocoding
  - **Real Road Routing**: Enhanced Baato API integration that follows actual roads and paths instead of showing straight lines between points
  - **Accessibility Obstacle Markers**: Red warning icons automatically placed on routes to mark stairs, steep slopes, and narrow paths that may be difficult for wheelchair users
  - **Enhanced Search**: Users can type location names and press Enter to search and automatically place markers
  - **Custom Markers**: Beautiful custom icons for start points (üöÄ), destinations (üèÅ), and various obstacle types (üö´ for stairs, ‚õ∞Ô∏è for slopes, ‚ÜîÔ∏è for narrow paths)
* **Dual Navigation System**: Two distinct interfaces - mobile camera navigation for real-time obstacle detection and desktop maps navigation for route planning
* **Wheelchair Route Optimization**: Advanced routing with options to avoid stairs, prefer low traffic routes, smooth surfaces, and accessible entrances
* **Baato API Integration**: Full integration with Nepal's mapping service for accurate local navigation, search, and place discovery
* **Accessibility-First Design**: All interfaces optimized for wheelchair users with large touch targets, high contrast, and voice guidance
